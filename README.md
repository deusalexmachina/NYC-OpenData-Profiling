# theBiggestData

Run as ./env.sh "basic_metadata.py /user/hm74/NYCOpenData 30 print"

Make sure you remove (rm) files named "average_time_record", "master_dct_0.json","master_itemset.json" and "run_time_record" from your running directory if running the code for the second time. 

@harman: I will add a module to check and remove these files if this becomes to much of a task in the future.
